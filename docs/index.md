# SexPistol



## Overview

All on GoLang about http servers handle are not comfortable in developing, to create a better experience to developer, I did think to create that framework with some facilities, templates and utils on web development like database default integration, Html templating and automations.

Every in SexPistol is in some level, a metaphor to pistols, and that is the why exists the submodules Cartridge (for databases), Casing (for html templates), UpLula (for route templates) and Bullet (the template for Rest APIs return).

### Pistol - Bullet trigger

That is the core of project, is why the SexPistol exists, and that is for create HTTP servers.

### Cartridge - Bullet chest

That is an wraper for database based on [Gorm](gorm.io), basicaly and Gorm with some customizations like Model templates contructor callbacks and pre-configurations.

### Casing - Casing of bullets

That is an wraper for `text/template` of Golang, to make HTML output on Pistol most easy.

### UpLula - Recharging automizator

That is an route template creator, for make automizations on common parts of project, like CRUD routes for models or similar situations.
